# Billing Settings

The billing settings page is where you can manage your billing information and settings. You can view your current billing information, update your billing email, and view your invoice history.

At the top of the page, you can visit your Stripe billing portal to make any adjustments to your payment method or see your invoice history.

Below that, you will see a running total for the current months' invoice.

You can also add billing contacts to your workspace that will be CC'd on all billing communication. This is useful for looping in email lists such as billing@company.com that might not require an account but should receive all invoice/billing information.

Finally, you can view your invoice history. This will show you all the invoices that have been generated for your account. These are Antimetal-generated invoices. Unlike the Stripe invoices, they will give a detailed breakdown of your usage and charges for each month.
