# Workspace Settings

A workspace is a collection of AWS accounts and users that you want to manage together.

On the workspace settings page, you can change the name of your workspace. Typically, this will be your company name.

You can also configure your autopilot settings. Autopilot automatically makes purchases of Compute and SageMaker savings plan on your behalf. Compute and SageMaker savings plans are highly flexible, and Antimetal uses a staggered savings plan approach to ensure that there is sufficient flexibility in the coverage levelâ€”read more about our approach [here](example.com).

Antimetal autopilot will only make Compute and SageMaker savings plan purchases on your behalf. Autopilot will never purchase reservations or EC2 savings plans.
