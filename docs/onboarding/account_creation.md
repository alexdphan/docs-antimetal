# Account Creation

To get started, create an account at [app.antimetal.com](https://app.antimetal.com).

You can sign up using Google or by entering your email address. If you sign up with email, you will be sent a magic link to login.

You will then be prompted to create a workspace. A workspace is a collection of AWS accounts and users that you want to manage together. We recommend naming your workspace after your company.
