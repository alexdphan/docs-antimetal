# Account Creation

To get started, create an account at [app.antimetal.com](https://app.antimetal.com).

You can sign up using Google or by entering your email address. If you sign up with email, you will be sent a magic link to login.

You will then be prompted to create a workspace. A workspace is a collection of AWS accounts and users that you want to manage together. We recommend naming your workspace after your company.

We also will need to collect some information about your company. This is required as part of our Know Your Customer (KYC) process.

You will be prompted to fill out a form with the following details:

- Company Name
- Company Website
- Billing Email
- Phone Number
- Company Details
