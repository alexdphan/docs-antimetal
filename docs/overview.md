# Overview

Antimetal allows customers to take advantage of higher savings rates with low risk.

AWS created the “organizations” feature for large corporations with one master billing account but thousands of separate AWS accounts. AWS organizations facilitate "discount sharing." This means the automated redistribution of RI and SP discounts to the accounts where they're most effective.

What does this mean for you?

- Higher discounts
  - Antimetal will purchase general-purpose savings instruments that will apply to all customers and bring savings across the board.
    AWS offers cheaper rates for cloud resources to larger organizations.
- Low Risk
  - Risk is hedged across all accounts in the organization. If a savings tool is going underutilized, it’s automatically redistributed to another account.
  - Reserved Instances first apply to the account they belong to. When a user has corresponding usage, this ensures savings for them. If they don’t, it will flow to another account in the group using that instance type. Similar logic applies for Savings Plans.

And it’s completely free.
