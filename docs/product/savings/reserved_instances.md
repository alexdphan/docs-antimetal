# Reserved Instance Recommendations

While Reserved Instances offer less flexibility than Savings Plans, they provide substantial savings for stable infrastructures. Antimetal generates Reserved Instances recommendations for services not covered by Savings Plans, simplifying the process to a single approval click. We advise aligning these purchases with your long-term planning to prevent overcommitment.
